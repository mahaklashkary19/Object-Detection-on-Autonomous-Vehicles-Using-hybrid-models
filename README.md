# Object Detection on Autonomous Vehicles Using Hybrid Models

**About the Project**  
This project focused on improving object detection systems for self-driving cars. I explored how combining different model architectures could enhance both accuracy and speed — crucial for real-time performance.

**What I Did**
- Built two hybrid object detection models by combining:
  - ViT (Vision Transformer) + YOLO
  - MobileViT + YOLO
- Trained both models on the KITTI dataset, a widely used benchmark for autonomous driving research.
- Focused on detecting vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real-time scenarios.
- Evaluated each model’s performance in terms of detection speed vs. accuracy to identify trade-offs and best-fit configurations for deployment.
