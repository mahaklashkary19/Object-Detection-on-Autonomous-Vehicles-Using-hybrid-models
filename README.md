# Object-Detection-on-Autonomous-Vehicles-Using-hybrid-models
**About the Project**
This project was all about improving object detection for self-driving cars. I explored how combining different model architectures could boost both accuracy and speed — something critical for real-time applications.

**What I Did**
- Built two hybrid object detection models by combining:
  - ViT (Vision Transformer) + YOLO
  - MobileViT + YOLO
- Trained both models on the KITTI dataset, which is widely used for autonomous driving research.
- Focused on detecting vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real-time scenarios.
- Evaluated how each hybrid model performed in terms of detection speed vs. accuracy, helping understand which setups work best under different constraints.
