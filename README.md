# Object-Detection-on-Autonomous-Vehicles-Using-hybrid-models
Imlemented YOLOv8 , YOLO11n and YOLO12n 
Developed two hybrid object detection models by integrating ViT + YOLO and MobileViT +  YOLO
Trained models on the KITTI dataset and compared performance to analyze trade-offs in speed and precision for autonomous vehicle scenarios.
